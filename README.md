# MVVM Compose Structure with Laravel Concepts and Room Database

This repository provides a structured template for building Android applications using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with Jetpack Compose. It also integrates concepts from Laravel, such as component items and clean routing, to enhance development efficiency and maintainability. Additionally, Room Database with SQLite is utilized for local data persistence, along with user preferences management.
